      The only thing you need to get these components is to install the package
      and import the components into your project. Once imported, you can use
      them directly in your HTML or within other components. They are designed
      to be easy to use, customizable, and fully functional out of the box,
      providing a seamless integration with your existing layout and design
      system. Additionally, you can modify the default styles by using the
      provided CSS variables, allowing you to customize the appearance of the
      components.
