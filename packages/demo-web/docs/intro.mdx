<Translate id="doc.how.to.use">The only thing you need to get these components is to install the package and import the components into your project. Once imported, you can use them directly in your HTML or within other components. They are designed to be easy to use, customizable, and fully functional out of the box, providing a seamless integration with your existing layout and design system. Additionally, you can modify the default styles by using the provided CSS variables, allowing you to customize the appearance of the components</Translate>
