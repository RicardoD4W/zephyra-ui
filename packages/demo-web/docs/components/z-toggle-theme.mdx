description: A component that uses SVG and can be used to switch between light and dark themes, provided by the data-theme attribute of the html tag. Note that without any type of integration or configuration it is functional on its own, it is even functional when integrated with other toggle components. Try changing the theme from the header and see how it automatically changes the appearance of the z-toggle-theme. You can also change the data-theme attribute of the html tag in the devtools and it will still react to the changes
